I am Recep. I have just graduated from Electrical and Electronics Engineering in Turkey and now currently studying master's degree 
in ICT Internet and Multimedia Engineering in Italy at University of Padua🏫. 
Being passionate about my job, I enjoy learning and applying my knowledge. Because of that I started to learn programming. 
I have learned C++, HTML,CSS, Java and finally I wanted to continue with Python. From my bachelor's degree I experienced many cards 
such as Arduino, STM32, Raspberry, FPGA, PLC. Anymore my future career will be on artificial intelligence😎.
